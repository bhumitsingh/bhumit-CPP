C++ STL
    - STL is a library that consist of different data structures and algorithms to 
      effectively store and manipulate data.
      - STL is a part of C++ Standard Library.
Most Common Data Structures:
    - Vector: Stores elements like an array, but can dynamically change in size.
              Adding and removing of elements are usually done at the end. elements
              can be accessed by index.
    - List: Stores elements sequentially, where each element is connected to the next.
            Adding and removing of elements can be done at both ends. Not accessible by index.
    - Stack: Stores elements in a specific order, called LIFO(Last In, First Out), where elements
             can be added and removed from the top. Not accessible by index.
    - Queue: Stores elements in a specific order, called FIFO(First In, First Out), where elements
             are added at the end and removed from the front. Not accessible by index.
    - Dequeue: Stores elements in a double-ended queue, where elemnets can be added and removed
               form both ends. Elements can be accessed by index.
    - Set: Stores unique elements. Not accessible by index.
    - Map: Stores elements in "key/value" pairs. Accessible by keys(not by index).
